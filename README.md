## Assignment 1
This project is used for the Assignment 1.

The main idea is to compare different serach operators and selection schemes on a set of benchmark functions. The functions are selected from [Yao et al., 1999]. For a fair comparison to the results by [Yao et al., 1999], please use the same budget, in terms of evaluation number as indicated in the MAT file [getFuncConfig.m](https://github.com/ljialin/SUSTechEC2019/blob/master/assignment1/utils/getFuncConfig.m) as well as [Yao et al., 1999].
